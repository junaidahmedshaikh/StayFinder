# 🚀 StayFinder – A Smart, Minimalist Platform for Renting & Hosting Homes 🏠

I'm excited to share **StayFinder**, a web platform I’ve been building where users can **find, book, and host** apartments, flats, villas, and homes in cities around the world — all at **affordable prices**.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🔍 Search and book properties by city or category  
- 🏡 Host your own home, flat, or villa with ease  
- 💻 Clean, minimalist UI/UX for a smooth user experience  
- 💬 User-friendly flow for both guests and hosts  

## ✨ Coming Soon: AI Integration

I’m actively working on adding AI-powered features to enhance the platform:

- 🤖 Smart property recommendations  
- ✍️ Automated listing descriptions  
- 🧠 Personalized booking suggestions
